### Hi there!

I'm currently looking for opportunities to solve interesting problems with kind people. I love saying "I don't know, but I can find out", I love helping teammates, and I love taking friction out of experiences for end-users, devs, and everyone else.

I've been working on a react / redux / nextjs / typescript site recently.
